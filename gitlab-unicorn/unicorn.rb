# Relative URL support
# WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
# of using a relative URL.
# Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
# Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path

# ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = "/gitlab"

# NOTICE: git push over http depends on this value.
# If you want to be able to push huge amount of data to git repository over http
# you will have to increase this value too.

# Example of output if you try to push 1GB repo to GitLab over http.
